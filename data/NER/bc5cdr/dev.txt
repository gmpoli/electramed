A O
76-year O

persistent O

azithromycin I-Entity

the O

Hiccups I-Entity
were O
persistent O

. O

Discontinuation O
of O

resolved O
hiccups I-Entity
. O

No O
organic O
cause O
of O
hiccups I-Entity
was O
identified O
despite O

investigation O
. O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Pharmacotherapeutic O
agents O
have O
been O
uncommonly O
associated O
with O
hiccups I-Entity
. O

Corticosteroids O
( O
dexamethasone I-Entity

, O
benzodiazepines I-Entity
( O
midazolam I-Entity

and O
general O

have O
been O
the O

agents O
mentioned O
most O
frequently O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
being O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
hiccups I-Entity

Few O
cases O
of O

Using O

because O
of O
the O
close O
temporal O

previous O

on O
this O
reaction O
with O
other O
macrolides I-Entity
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
alternative O
explanation O
for O
hiccups I-Entity
. O

Our O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
vagal O
mechanism O

by O
azithromycin I-Entity
could O
be O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
hiccups I-Entity
in O
our O

However O
, O
macrolide I-Entity
antimicrobials O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
hiccups I-Entity

vagal O
mechanism O

that O

share O
a O

In O

whether O
the O

true O
for O

in O

The O
specific O

was O
to O
elucidate O
whether O
an O
aura O
and/or O
an O
attack O
of O
migraine B-Entity
without I-Entity

could O
be O

Headache I-Entity
was O

In O
the O

, O
the O

gradually O

in O

At O
this O

the O

fulfilled O
the O
diagnostic O
criteria O
for O

of O
the O

The O

suggest O
that O
NO I-Entity

in O
the O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Drug O

play O
a O
role O

He O
initially O

he O
had O
two O

The O
patient O
remained O

there O
is O
a O
role O
for O
aggressive O

rather O
augmented O
the O

this O

that O

We O

that O

our O

Excitotoxicity I-Entity

a O

In O

the O

Here O

We O

with O

, O
a O

Importantly O
, O
D2R O

mice O
develop O

at O
doses O
of O
both O
drugs O
that O
are O
not O
epileptogenic O
for O

show O
greater O

However O
, O
pilocarpine I-Entity

both O

Thus O

the O

Moreover O
, O
the O

Melatonin I-Entity

however O
, O

In O

, O
low O
doses O
reduced O
the O

prolonged O
the O
duration O

. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
highest O
dose O
of O
melatonin I-Entity
( O
50 O
mg O
/ O
kg O
) O
caused O
a O
paradoxical O
increase O
in O
the O
latency O
and O
produced O
a O
sustained O
reduction O
of O
the O
duration O
of O
narcosis I-Entity

and O
a O
reduction O
in O

rate O
. O

Melatonin I-Entity
0.5 O

Thus O

the O

BACKGROUND O

, O
the O
rates O

during O

remain O
relatively O
unchanged O
. O

Early O
identification O
of O
fetal O
alcohol I-Entity
exposure O
and O
maternal O
abstinence O
led O
to O
better O

This O

who O
were O
enrolled O
in O

Because O

When O

Any O
alcohol I-Entity

resulted O
in O

Using O
a O
positron O

( O

study O
it O
was O
shown O
recently O
that O
in O

certain O

activated O
during O

not O
in O

It O
was O
suggested O
that O
this O

is O
inherent O
to O
the O

itself O
and O
represents O
the O
so O
called O

' O

To O
test O
this O
hypothesis O
we O
performed O
an O
experimental O

in O
seven O

, O
using O
the O

in O
the O

A O
small O

administered O
subcutaneously O

evoke O

Using O

in O

found O

The O
increase O
of O

that O
this O

However O

been O
implicated O

We O
have O
studied O
the O
role O

NO I-Entity

its O
association O
with O

in O
an O
experimental O
model O
of O
nephrotic B-Entity
syndrome I-Entity
induced O
by O
a O

of O
adriamycin I-Entity
( O

. O

The O
alteration O

assessed O
by O
measuring O

These O
two O

RESULTS O
: O
Histopathological O
examination O

They O
also O
had O

( O

In O
the O

However O
, O
in O

, O
numerous O

were O
identified O
in O
the O

Treatment O
with O
AG I-Entity
prevented O
the O
impairment O

reduced O
both O

: O
We O
suggest O
that O
interactions O

important O

It O
is O

, O
a O
model O
of O

was O
considered O

Therefore O

Carteolol I-Entity
, O
as O

as O
propranolol I-Entity
and O

, O
inhibited O
the O

The O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
carteolol I-Entity
was O
almost O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
propranolol I-Entity
, O
but O
was O
weaker O
than O
that O
of O

Carteolol I-Entity

stimulating O
behavioral O

such O
as O
stereotypy O

Carteolol I-Entity
did O
not O
antagonize O

of O

on O

- O
induced O
stereotypy O

In O
addition O
, O
carteolol I-Entity
did O
not O

stimulating O
behavioral O
signs O
such O
as O
flat O

did O
not O
inhibit O
5-hydroxytryptophan I-Entity
- O
induced O
head O

in O

. O

Finally O
, O
carteolol I-Entity
did O
not O
inhibit O
physostigmine I-Entity

induced O

in O

. O

These O
results O
strongly O

that O

improves O
haloperidol I-Entity
- O
induced O
catalepsy I-Entity
via O
its O
beta O

adrenoceptor O
antagonistic O

and O
is O
expected O
to O

effective O
in O

Apomorphine I-Entity

the O
first O
dopaminergic O

ever O
used O
to O
treat O
symptoms O

Parkinson B-Entity

. O

While O
powerful O
antiparkinsonian O
effects O
had O
been O
observed O
as O
early O
as O

, O
the O
potential O
of O
treating O

Parkinson B-Entity

disease I-Entity
by O
subcutaneous O
administration O
of O
apomorphine I-Entity
has O
only O
recently O
become O
the O
subject O
of O
systematic O
study O
. O

A O
number O
of O
small O
scale O
clinical O
trials O
have O
unequivocally O
shown O
that O
intermittent O
subcutaneous O
apomorphine I-Entity
injections O
produce O
antiparkinsonian O
benefit O
close O
if O
not O
identical O
to O
that O
seen O
with O

that O

can O
reliably O
revert O

Continuous O

reduce O

more O
than O
50% O
in O
this O
group O

, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
a O

that O

of O
up O

8 O
years O
have O
demonstrated O
long O

term O
persistence O
of O
apomorphine I-Entity
efficacy O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
convincing O
clinical O
evidence O
that O
monotherapy O
with O
continuous O
subcutaneous O
apomorphine I-Entity
infusions O
is O
associated O
with O
marked O
reductions O
of O

The O
main O

effects O
of O

are O
related O

subcutaneous O
apomorphine I-Entity
treatment O
in O
fluctuating O

this O

Thirty O

the O
210 O

( O
17.2% O

However O
, O
30% O

administered O
in O
excess O
of O
36 O
hours O
