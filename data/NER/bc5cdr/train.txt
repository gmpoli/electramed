Subsequently O

Thus O
the O

seems O
to O
depend O
on O

The O

This O

the O

This O

that O

In O

the O

may O
induce O

through O

Because O

had O
no O

on O
the O

produced O
by O
vitamin B-Entity
D I-Entity
, O
the O
synergy O
between O
Warfarin I-Entity

vitamin B-Entity
D I-Entity
is O
probably O
best O
explained O
by O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
Warfarin I-Entity
inhibits O
the O

: O
Cholestatic B-Entity

, O
which O
resolved O
after O

An O

revealed O
that O
the O

was O
probably O
related O
to O
the O
use O

The O
mechanisms O
of O
this O
ticlopidine I-Entity

this O

Habitual O

: O
a O
comparison O
with O
phenacetin I-Entity
. O

Six O
epidemiologic O
studies O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
indicate O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
phenacetin I-Entity
is O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
chronic B-Entity
renal I-Entity
failure I-Entity
and O
end B-Entity
- I-Entity
stage I-Entity
renal I-Entity
disease I-Entity
( O
ESRD I-Entity
) O
, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
4 O
to O
19 O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
and O
other O
studies O
, O
phenacetin I-Entity
has O
now O
been O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
market O
in O
most O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
three O
case O
control O
studies O
, O
one O
each O
in O
North O
Carolina O
, O
northern O
Maryland O
, O
and O
West O
Berlin O
, O
Germany O
, O
showed O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen I-Entity
is O
also O
associated O
with O
chronic B-Entity
renal I-Entity
failure I-Entity
and O
ESRD I-Entity
, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
2 O
to O
4 O
. O

These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
both O
phenacetin I-Entity
and O
acetaminophen I-Entity
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
burden O
of O
ESRD I-Entity
, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
latter O
being O
somewhat O
less O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O
. O

This O
apparent O
difference O
in O
risk O
may O
not O
be O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
nephrotoxic I-Entity
potential O
of O
the O
drugs O
themselves O
. O

A O
lower O
relative O
risk O
would O
be O
expected O
for O
acetaminophen I-Entity
if O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
drugs O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
risk O
of O
either O
agent O
alone O
. O

Thus O
, O
acetaminophen I-Entity
has O
been O
used O
both O
as O
a O
single O
agent O
and O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
, O
whereas O
phenacetin I-Entity
was O
available O
only O
in O
combinations O
. O

The O
possibility O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen I-Entity
alone O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
ESRD I-Entity
has O
not O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated O
, O
but O
can O
not O
be O
dismissed O
. O

Sirolimus I-Entity
is O
a O
novel O
immunosuppressant O
with O
potent O
antiproliferative O
actions O
through O
its O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
the O
raptor O

of O

Sirolimus I-Entity
represents O
a O

advance O
in O
the O

of O
acute O

Because O
sirolimus I-Entity
does O
not O
share O
the O

adverse O

exhibited O
by O

, O

has O
been O
designated O
a O

However O
, O
clinical O

suggest O
that O
, O
under O
some O
circumstances O
, O
sirolimus I-Entity
is O
associated O
with O
proteinuria I-Entity

A O
common O

The O
mechanisms O
of O
sirolimus I-Entity

proteinuria I-Entity
are O
multifactorial O
and O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
in O

pressure O
following O
calcineurin O

. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
sirolimus I-Entity
directly O
causes O
increased O
glomerular O

but O
evidence O

this O
mechanism O

associated O
with O
sirolimus I-Entity
( O
such O
as O
in O

may O
be O
due O

Although O
these O

in O
some O

their O
occurrence O
could O
be O
minimised O
by O
knowledge O

These O
observations O

that O

an O

that O

Whether O

we O

We O

: O

These O

However O
, O

We O
wanted O

FS O

The O

Thus O

INTERPRETATION O
: O

, O
use O

The O
role O
of O
nicotine I-Entity
in O
smoking O
- O
related O
cardiovascular B-Entity
disease I-Entity
. O

Nicotine I-Entity
activates O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
and O
in O
this O
way O
could O
contribute O
to O
cardiovascular B-Entity
disease I-Entity
. O

Animal O
studies O
and O
mechanistic O
studies O
indicate O
that O
nicotine I-Entity
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
accelerating O
atherosclerosis I-Entity
, O
but O
evidence O
among O
humans O
is O
too O
inadequate O
to O
be O
definitive O
about O
such O
an O
effect O
. O

Almost O
certainly O
, O
nicotine I-Entity
via O
its O
hemodynamic O
effects O
contributes O
to O
acute O
cardiovascular O
events O
, O
although O
current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine I-Entity
are O
much O
less O
important O
than O
are O
the O
prothrombotic O
effects O
of O
cigarette O
smoking O
or O
the O
effects O
of O
carbon B-Entity

Nicotine I-Entity
does O
not O
appear O
to O
enhance O
thrombosis I-Entity
among O
humans O
. O

Clinical O
studies O
of O
pipe O
smokers O
and O
people O
using O
transdermal O
nicotine I-Entity
support O
the O
idea O
that O
toxins O
other O
than O
nicotine I-Entity
are O
the O
most O
important O
causes O
of O
acute O
cardiovascular O
events O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
dose O
response O
for O
cardiovascular O
events O

appears O
to O
be O
flat O
, O
suggesting O
that O

Several O

Previous O

that O

a O

The O
aim O

to O
investigate O
the O

that O

By O

The O

that O

restored O
the O

We O

that O

may O
significantly O
improve O
the O

Although O

the O
effect O

is O

documented O
. O

The O
sample O
for O
the O
study O
consisted O
of O
50 O
patients O
to O
whom O
subcutaneous O

administered O
. O

Heparin I-Entity
was O
injected O
over O
10 O
seconds O
on O
the O

Dimensions O

The O

The O

It O
was O

that O
the O

in O
the O

Pain I-Entity

were O
statistically O

a O

These O

The O

It O
could O
