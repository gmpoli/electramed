in O
some O

however O
, O
this O

The O

To O
examine O
the O

Additionally O

Thus O

our O

Our O

This O

In O

The O

Cimetidine I-Entity
, O
a O
histamine I-Entity
2 O
( O

antagonist O
, O
produces O
a O
decrease O
in O

due O

vasodilatation O
, O

This O
may O
be O
because O
cimetidine I-Entity
acts O
as O
a O
histamine I-Entity

. O

We O
, O
therefore O
, O
investigated O
the O

We O
conclude O
that O
an O

may O
be O
useful O
in O
preventing O
hypotension I-Entity
caused O
by O
iv O

Hypertension I-Entity

Hypertension I-Entity
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
finding O
in O
some O
patients O
with O
neuroblastoma I-Entity
. O

However O
, O
it O
has O
not O
previously O
been O
described O
in O
association O
with O
the O
use O
of O
Imipramine I-Entity

We O
report O
the O
occurrence O
of O
severe O
hypertension I-Entity
( O
blood O

190/160 O
) O
in O
a O
4-year O
- O
old O
girl O
with O
neuroblastoma I-Entity
who O
was O
given O
Imipramine I-Entity
to O
control O
a O
behavior B-Entity
disorder I-Entity
. O

It O
was O
determined O
later O
that O
this O
patient O
's O
tumor I-Entity
was O
recurring O
at O
the O
time O
of O
her O
hypertensive I-Entity
episode O
. O

Since O
she O
had O
no O
blood O

at O
initial O
diagnosis O
and O
none O
following O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
Imipramine I-Entity
( O
when O
she O
was O
in O
florid O
relapse O
) O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
this O
drug O
rather O
than O
her O
underlying O
disease O
alone O
caused O
her O
hypertension I-Entity
. O

The O
mechanism O
for O
this O
reaction O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
increased O
levels O
of O
vasoactive O
catecholamines I-Entity
due O
to O
interference O
of O
their O
physiologic O
inactivation O
by O

From O
this O
experience O
, O
we O
urge O
extreme O
caution O
in O
the O
use O
of O
tricyclic O
antidepressants O
in O
children O
with O
active O
neuroblastoma I-Entity

When O

, O
seven O

these O
15 O

were O

These O

but O
60% O
( O

We O
conclude O
that O
patients O
may O
be O
restarted O
on O

when O
clinically O

; O
however O
, O
because O
of O

not O

That O

For O
this O

Heparin I-Entity
, O

been O
clinically O
used O
to O
treat O
thrombosis I-Entity
for O
more O
than O
50 O
years O
. O

Although O
several O

, O
heparin I-Entity
remains O
the O
anticoagulant O

The O
clinical O

These O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Acetaminophen I-Entity
( O

( O

are O
widely O

analgesic O

drugs O
. O

The O
rate O

Celecoxib I-Entity

is O
a O
novel O
drug O

We O
evaluated O
the O
tolerability O
of O
CE I-Entity
in O
a O
group O
of O
patients O
with O
documented O
history O
of O
adverse O
cutaneous B-Entity
reactions I-Entity
to O
P I-Entity

N I-Entity

not O

: O
We O

hypersensitivity I-Entity
to O
P I-Entity
and O
N I-Entity
with O
or O
without O
associated O
reactions O
to O
classic O
NSAIDs O
. O

The O
diagnosis O
of O
P I-Entity
and O
N I-Entity

induced O
skin B-Entity

was O
based O
in O

After O

a O
cumulative O
dosage O
of O
200 O

The O

was O
considered O
positive O
if O
one O

of O
the O
following O
appeared O
: O
erythema I-Entity

No O

observed O

eight O

( O

tolerated O
CE I-Entity

Only O
one O

CONCLUSION O
: O
Only O
one O

Thus O

we O

that O

to O

The O

: O
Our O

Regular O

its O

still O
controversial O

In O

this O

we O
have O

the O

Thereafter O

During O
the O

we O
measured O

ended O
. O

All O
these O
behavioral O
parameters O
showed O
statistically O
significant O
changes O
suggesting O
that O
regular O

decrease O

Tonic O

Endogenous O

of O
the O
dopamine I-Entity
precursor O
levodopa I-Entity
enhances O

Because O
levodopa I-Entity
increases O
both O
phasic O
and O
tonic O
dopaminergic O
neurotransmission O
, O
the O
critical O
mechanism O

the O

unresolved O

The O
dopamine I-Entity

significantly O
impaired B-Entity

compared O

Subjects O
treated O
with O
pergolide I-Entity
also O
showed O
restricted O

the O
PLACEBO O
group O
. O

The O
extent O

affect O
with O
pergolide I-Entity
was O
related O
to O
the O
degree O
of O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
tonic O
occupation O
of O
dopamine I-Entity
receptors O
impairs O
learning O
by O
competition O
with O
phasic O
dopamine I-Entity
signals O
. O

Thus O
, O
phasic O
signaling O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
critical O
mechanism O
by O
which O
dopamine I-Entity
enhances O
associative O
learning O
in O
healthy O

We O

Here O
we O
had O
the O

In O
this O
case O
, O
lymph O

performed O
before O

six O

Comparison O

the O
two O

showed O
that O
temsirolimus I-Entity
inhibited O

, O
but O
did O
not O
induce O

Apart O
from O
this O
cytostatic O

, O
temsirolimus I-Entity
had O
an O
antiangiogenic O

Thus O
, O
temsirolimus I-Entity
reduced O

anti O

angiogenic O
effects O
. O

This O
